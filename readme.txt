== Description ==
Reverse the post order for a specific category to be date ascending. This is a lightweight plugin that adds the option to reorder the posts from a specific category by published date (ascending or descending). When creating or editing a category from the Admin Dashboard, the user can choose to sort the posts for that category by oldest (old posts on top of the page) or newest (new posts first). Useful for journals, books or achives, who need to have a chronological sort order for certain category archives.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where are the options? =
When editing or updating a category from the WordPress dashboard (click on posts => categories => edit), a dropdown to select options will appear after the category description. The options are "Oldest" (show posts by date ascending or the so called chronological order) or "Newest" (show posts by date ascending or the WordPress way). The default value is "Newest", which is the same as the WordPress default post sort.
When you choose "Oldest", the plugin will automatically display the posts from that category archive page in chronological order.

= Are there more options to sort the posts?
The plugin currently does not have any more options. However, it can be forked to sort posts by other criteria, including post title. It can also be adjusted to sort posts by more than one criteria. Feel free to contact me for more information on how to do it! The plugin does exactly what it states it does. If you like it, please give it a 5-star rating.
